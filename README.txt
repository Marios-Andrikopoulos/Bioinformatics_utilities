A list of bioinformatics scripts that primarily aim to expedite phylogenetic work.

nexus_merge: a tool for merging nexus files. Can be used with the next tool if paramater -t is set to True. In that case both scripts should be in the same directory.

nexus_edit: a tool to replace indels in sequential nexus files ("-") with missing ("?"), when in start and end of alignment, or between unknown residues ("X")

codon_usage_analysis : a script that prints out codon usage frequences in coding sequences

hgt: a script to highlight potential horisontal gene transfer events, for now hardcoded to work with Metarhizium genus. Will change
